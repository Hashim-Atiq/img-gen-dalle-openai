# AI Genrated Image Showcase

This project demonstrates the capabilities of OpenAI's DALL-E 2 model and OpenAI's API's by creating an interactive web application that allows users to generate, showcase, and download AI-generated images based on their prompts. You get your very own private showcase.

## Features
The calculator app includes the following features:

- Image Gallery: Browse through a gallery of AI-generated images, each accompanied by the prompt that inspired it. A download button is provided for easy image retrieval.
- Keyword Search: Use the search bar to find specific images. The app displays images whose prompts contain the entered search keywords.
- Generate Your Own: On a separate page, users can input their own prompts and generate AI images. A preview of the generated image is displayed, and users have the option to share it directly to the gallery.

## Screenshots
Here are few screenshots showcasing the user interface and functionality of the applicataion:
